We performed analysis of the contacts and proximity between residues in the structure of LC3B and estimate breaking and forming events, using the CONtact ANalysis (CONAN) software. All the parameters used for the calculation are contained in the fine.inp
To run the analysis with CONAN use the bash script script.sh
To plot the data use the R script script_plot_all.R
