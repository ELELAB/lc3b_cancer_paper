Read 100001 frames from ../filt_trjs/noCNter.xtc (time 0 to 1e+06 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from ../filt_tprs/noCNter.tpr

Analysis group is 'C-alpha' (110 atoms)
Fit group is 'C-alpha' (110 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 330x330 covariance matrix
