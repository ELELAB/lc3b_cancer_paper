The repository contains the input data for modeling and simulations, outputs from analyses and associated scripts to reproduce our data. 
The the MD trajectories, mutatex and rosetta scans  have been deposited in OSF due to space limitation. They can be downloaded from here:

A more detailed README file is in each subfolder


1. pdbs/ -> preprocessing and cleaning steps for the PDB files
2. simulations_analysis -> all the analyses done on free and membrane-bound simulations
