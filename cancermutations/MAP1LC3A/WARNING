19/10/2018,10:07 WARNING [cancermuts.cBioPortal]> for mutation G11E, residue G is R in wild-type sequence; it will be skipped
19/10/2018,10:07 WARNING [cancermuts.cBioPortal]> for mutation S8Y, residue S is K in wild-type sequence; it will be skipped
19/10/2018,10:07 WARNING [cancermuts.cBioPortal]> for mutation D60H, residue D is M in wild-type sequence; it will be skipped
19/10/2018,10:07 WARNING [cancermuts.cBioPortal]> for mutation F5L, residue F is R in wild-type sequence; it will be skipped
19/10/2018,10:07 WARNING [cancermuts.cBioPortal]> for mutation K12R, residue K is S in wild-type sequence; it will be skipped
